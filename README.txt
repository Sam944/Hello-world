# Hello-world
My first repository

Hello world!
My name is Sam and I'm a ะก# beginner so don't judge strictly. I have recently started to study HTML, PHP, CSS, JS and SQl.
Here are my 1st programm:

//Generate array from 1000 elements
elements=[x for i in range(0, 1000)];
print(elements);
//Create a cycle which the following el +1
for i in elements{
if i == 0
print(elements[i]+1);
}

Three years later I've become autotester
